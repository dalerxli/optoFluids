! Rules:
! All items should be on a separate line.
! Vectors start with a '(' and end with a ')', space-separated.
! A line starting with a '!' indicates a comment-line
! Half-way a line, a comment may be started with a '!', escaped with a '\': '\!'
! Maximum length of a line = 250, but no line continuation is supported. The same applies to filenames.

! This inputfile has Gyllion's experimental values.
