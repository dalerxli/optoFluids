This is a sentence with a variable to be substituted.
\$varname\$ is used to substitute a variable.
For example, varname=SomeNumber will be substituted as follows:
blabla \$SomeNumber\$ = $SomeNumber$ blabla $SomeOtherNumber$$SomeNumber$
Interesting concept, right?

If one wishes to print "backslash dollar", one may simply type "\\$".
! This line is a comment, because the FIRST CHARACTER is "!". Escape using: "\!".
\! So this line is not a comment and will appear in the substituted file. This is NOT escaped: \!.
\! Only "\!" as the first two characters will be escaped.

!$NotExistingVariableName$ will raise a fatal error.
!$varName$=$ Dollar-sign mismatch will raise a fatal error.
