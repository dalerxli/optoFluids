This is a sentence with a variable to be substituted.
\$varname\$ is used to substitute a variable.
For example, varname=SomeNumber will be substituted as follows:
blabla \$SomeNumber\$ = $SomeNumber$ blabla
Interesting concept, right?

If one wishes to print "backslash dollar", one may simply type \\$. The backslash is not an escape character. Only a single blackslash followed by a single dollar sign means something.
! This line is a comment, because the FIRST CHARACTER is an exclamation mark.
